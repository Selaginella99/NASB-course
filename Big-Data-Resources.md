National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Cancer Target Discovery and Development ([CTD2](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2/using-ctd2-data)) 
under [the Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/csoft/chemical-biology/project-cancer-dependencies-%E2%80%93-ctd2/canc). CTD2 is a cancer phenotypingp roject that seeks to identify novel cancer **drug targets** and novel **biomarkers** for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of drug response.

Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets [(BioGRID)](http://thebiogrid.org/) is a database of **protein-protein** interactions.

Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [(CCLE)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/cprg/?q=node/11) is a database of **gene expression**, genotype (copy number and mutation status of genes), and drug sensitivity data for human cancer cell lines.

Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [(COSMIC)](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/) is a database of information about somatic mutations in cancer/cancer *tissue* obtained from curation of relevant **literature** and from **high-throughput sequencing data** generated by the Cancer Genome Project and other cancer profiling projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Project.



The Phenotype-Genotype Integrator [(PheGenI)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni) on NCBI.
