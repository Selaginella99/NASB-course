National Cancer Instituteâ€™s Cancer Target Discovery and Development ([CTD2](https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/ctd2/using-ctd2-data)) 
under [the Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/scientific-community/science/programs/csoft/chemical-biology/project-cancer-dependencies-%E2%80%93-ctd2/canc). CTD2 is a cancer phenotypingp roject that seeks to identify novel cancer **drug targets** and novel **biomarkers** for diagnosis of cancer and prediction of drug response.

Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets [(BioGRID)](http://thebiogrid.org/) is a database of **protein-protein** interactions.

Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia [(CCLE)](http://www.broadinstitute.org/software/cprg/?q=node/11) is a database of **gene expression**, genotype (copy number and mutation status of genes), and drug sensitivity data for human cancer cell lines.

Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer [(COSMIC)](http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/cosmic/) is a database of information about somatic mutations in cancer/cancer *tissue* obtained from curation of relevant **literature** and from **high-throughput sequencing data** generated by the Cancer Genome Project and other cancer profiling projects such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Project.

Universal Protein Resource [(UniProt)](http://www.uniprot.org/) is a database containing diverse types of information about proteins (**domain annotations**).

[DrugBank](http://www.drugbank.ca/) is a manually curated database of information about drugs and their targets (*not only protein*).

Encyclopedia of DNA Elements ([ENCODE](https://www.encodeproject.org/)) is a genome mapping project that seeks to annotate the human genome with information about genes and elements that regulate gene transcription, such as transcription factor binding sites. ENCODE at [UCSC](http://genome.ucsc.edu/ENCODE/).

Gene Ontology [GO](http://geneontology.org/) annotates genes with biological terms selected from a structured vocabulary.
Gene Reference Into Function ([GeneRIF](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/about-generif)) is another gene annotation project that is a manually curated collection of short statements, each describing a function of a gene.

[Reactome](http://www.reactome.org/) is a database of biomolecular pathways, there are other pathway databases like Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ([KEGG](http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)) and [WikiPathways](http://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/WikiPathways).


The Phenotype-Genotype Integrator [(PheGenI)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap/phegeni) on NCBI.
